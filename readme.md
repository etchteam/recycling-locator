# Recycling Locator

## Welsh language support

Use the `locale` attribute to set the language. `cy` is currently the only supported language code.

```html
<recycling-locator locale="cy"></recycling-locator>
```

## Prefilled location

Provide the `postcode` attribute to skip initial location entry.

```html
<recycling-locator postcode="AB123CD"></recycling-locator>
```
