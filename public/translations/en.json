          "question": "Do I need special containers to refill?",
          "answerBold": "Absolutely not - any clean, dry container works perfectly.",
          "answer": "Old jam jars, pasta sauce bottles, or containers you already have at home are ideal. Most shops also sell reusable food safe containers if you want to upgrade your storage game. Many places provide containers if you forget to bring your own, and some even offer a \"container library\" where you can borrow and return. The key is bringing containers that are clean and dry - the friendly staff will show you exactly what works best for different products."

          "answerBold": "Every small action adds up to something bigger.",
          "answer": "When you refill a 500ml bottle instead of buying a new one, you're preventing that plastic from being manufactured, transported, and eventually disposed of. Multiply that by your weekly shopping and the growing number of people choosing refill, and the impact becomes significant. But beyond the environmental benefits, you're supporting local businesses, reducing clutter in your home, and often saving money too."
